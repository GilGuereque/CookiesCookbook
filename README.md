# Cookies Cookbook

> This application lets the user create and save cookie recipes. The user can select the ingredients that will be included in the recipe from a list. The recipe is then saved to a text file along with recipes that have been created before. 
The text file might be either in a *.txt or a *.json format, depending on the setting defined in a program.
